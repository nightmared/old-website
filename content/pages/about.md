Hi,
I'm Simon THOBY, a 16 years old student fascinated by computer science and physics (although I also enjoys maths).

My main centers of interest are physics (especially quantum physics), computer security (including cryptography), programming (in C++, Rust or even Python) and sci-phy.

I love FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) such as Mozilla's browser or OpenBSD's ssh ! So I use Linux as my main OS and I sometimes play with BSDs. So, please: Never speak to me about Windows or even about Mac OS X ! I prefer to use a much cleaner OS (Crux or Gentoo) with a clean init (OpenRC for example). To say the truth, I'm not a huge fan of a well know init^Wbloat called systemd ! :)
