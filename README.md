This is the sources for my website (hosted on my Raspberry Pi B+ @ home, and as you could see in the publishconf.py file, I send this files with ssh as root [I know it's bad but I'm a lazy guy :p]) (Note: as you have seen, I also use github pages to share my website).

If you want to use or manipulate this small homepage, you must know that it uses [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), and they have a great documentation [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.0/).

Feel free to contact me or send a PR to improve the theme (derived from [this one](https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme/pure)), correct articles or simply explaining me I'm doing some thing wrong and why.
