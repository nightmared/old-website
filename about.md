# Who am I ?

Hi,

I'm Simon THOBY, a 17 years old student fascinated by computer sciences and physics (although I also enjoys maths).

My main centers of interest, as already said, are physics (especially quantum physics), computer security (including cryptography), programming (in C++, Rust and sometimes shell scripts) and sci-phy.

I love FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) such as Mozilla's browser, their experimental rendering engine Servo or OpenBSD's ssh ! So I use Linux as my main OS and I sometimes play with BSDs (not enough maybe :P). 

But there is ont thing you must know about me: Never ask me things concerning Windows or even Mac OS X ! They aren't UNIX, they don't (or poorly) comply with POSIX and treat user's datas as their own properties. You might also be interested to know that I have some ethicals disagreements with systemd's way of thinking. To be short: I hate their philosophy, way too far from the KISS and "Do One Thing, Do It Well" principles. I prefer to use a much cleaner OS (a light GNU/Linux ditribution such as Alpine or Gentoo or some BSDs) with a clean init (OpenRC for example).
