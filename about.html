<h1>Who am I ?</h1>

<p>I'm Simon THOBY, a student fascinated by computer sciences, maths and sometimes physics.</p>
<p>My main centers of interest, as already said, are computer security (including cryptography), programming (in C, Rust and sometimes shell scripts when I want to do horribleC^Whacky stuff), sci-phy.</p>

<p>I love FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) such as Mozilla's browser, their experimental rendering engine Servo or voidlinux package manager, <a href="https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps">xbps</a> (try it out, it's insanely fast compared to rpm or aptitude).</p> 

<p>I appreciate living on the edge (<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">wayland</a>, <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">sway</a>, rolling-release, etc...).
While I don't care a lot about stability, I do care about clean design (while being realistic, of course, no technology is perfect).</p>
<p>As such, I have some ethicals disagreements with systemd internals and the disrespect expressed against people who complains (sometimes with good rationales) about a problem. I believe this attitude explains much of the conflict about it.

systemd, while providing some great new advances in init management, achieves to force end users and developers to rely on their stack (inability to fully disable journalctl or to use eudev with systemd). This monolithic approach is also not one I agree upon, so... I don't like it.

That's why I only use distributions using other init systems (e.g. runit).

But I don't want to bash, I can understand why some people like/love the given software and I fully disagree with people bashing on systemd's creator instead of having constructive remarks on his work itself.

Attacking people instead of his ideas/works isn't productive and can be hurtful, for the developer/maintainer/whatever involved but also for the community (this destroy bonds between devs and the users).

So please, don't start a new flame war with me, we would both save some time and effort.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Love physics, math and computers. Wants free softwares everywhere (with BSD licenses of course) !</p>
