<h1>Who am I ?</h1>

<p>I'm Simon THOBY, a student fascinated by computer sciences and physics (although I also enjoys maths).</p>
<p>My main centers of interest, as already said, are physics (especially quantum physics), computer security (including cryptography), programming (in C++, Rust and sometimes shell scripts when I want to do hacky stuff), sci-phy.</p>

<p>I love FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) such as Mozilla's browser, their experimental rendering engine Servo or voidlinux package manager, <a href="https://github.com/voidlinux/xbps">xbps</a>.</p> 

<p>I appreciate living on the edge (<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">wayland</a>, <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">sway</a>, rolling-release, etc...).
While I don't care a lot about stability, I do care about clean design.
As such, I have some ethicals disagreements with systemd internals and the disrespect expressed against people who complains (with good reasons) about a problem.
This attitude explains much of the conflict about it.
Furthermore, in my point of view, systemd is just technically inferior and doesn't deserve me to waste time on it.
That's why I only use distributions using other init systems (e.g. runit).</p>

<p>TL;DR: Love physics, math and computers. Wants free softwares everywhere (with BSD licenses of course) !</p>
